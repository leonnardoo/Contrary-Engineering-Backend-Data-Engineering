# Part 1 - Ingestion

In this part i created a script to delete table, create table and insert table for the both cases in the test. People and Companies. The database chosen is SQLite because is simple and complete for this test.
If change the quantity of data and respect the schema we don't gona have problem in the script.

Examples:

    python.exe ingest.py -u https://contrary-engineering-interview.s3.amazonaws.com/data/companies.csv

    python.exe ingest.py -u https://contrary-engineering-interview.s3.amazonaws.com/data/people.csv

Result:

    Insert data sucessful.

    python.exe question_05.py

# Part 3 - Build an application

In this part i have to build an API to respond the suggests endpoints.

1)  /avg-funding-by-person/[person_id]
2)  /companies-by-person/[person_id]
3)  /investors-by-company/[company_linkedin_name]

        python.exe app.py

For test we just need to acess the localhost:5000/[endpoint] or any tool for API. I use Insomnia.

    /avg-funding-by-person/[person_id]
